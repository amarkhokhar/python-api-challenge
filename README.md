# python-api-challenge

This project attempts to analyze weather data from the open weather api and geography data from the geoapify api. Weather data takes in data from different cities such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Using the data, a dataframe is created to perform linear regression analyses on latitude and the various weather considerations listed above. This analysis was completed in WeatherPy.

The project goes on to use hvplots to analyze and visualize a map the cities and is correctly sized to humidity values. Data is also visualized to show what hotels are closest to cities with your ideal weather conditions. Analysis is in VacationPy file.

StackOverflow and google searches were used to see how to convert temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius. Additionally, StackOverflow was used to see how to drop null values in a dataset.
